DO NOT RUN THIS.  IT NEEDS WORK STILL

.SYNOPSIS
    Safely removes a Hyper-V virtual machine and its associated files.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function deletes a VM from Hyper-V, removes its virtual hard disk (VHDX),
    and deletes the VM folder. It's intended for test environments where VMs are
    disposable and can be recreated quickly.

    To use this script:
    1. Save it as a .ps1 file (e.g., Remove-TestVM.ps1)
    2. Dot-source it in your PowerShell session: . .\Remove-VM.ps1
    3. Call the function: Remove-VM -vmName "MyVM" -vmPath "C:\Hyper-V\MyVM"

.NOTES
    - This script does NOT log actions or prompt for confirmation.
    - It assumes the VM folder contains a VHDX file named after the VM.
    - Customize paths and names as needed for your environment.
